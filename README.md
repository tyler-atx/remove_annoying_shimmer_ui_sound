# remove_annoying_shimmer_ui_sound
Victoria 3 Mod that removes an annoying UI sound that loops. This will help players who do not use the in-game music and hear all the sounds.  

The shimmer sound can appear from multiple UI elements. The bookmarks, the tech tree, and others. Removing one source of the shimmer sound can temporarily relieve the player, but it will often reappear shortly after. This mod will remove the shimmer sound effect from the parent template for many UI elements.
